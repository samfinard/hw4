Hoof and mouth disease (also known as foot-and-mouth disease) is a highly contagious viral infection that affects cloven-hoofed animals, including cattle, sheep, and pigs. The disease is characterized by the formation of blisters in the mouth and on the hooves, leading to difficulty in eating and lameness. While not typically fatal, it can lead to significant economic losses in the livestock industry due to reduced productivity and trade restrictions. Controlling the spread of hoof and mouth disease involves strict biosecurity measures, including quarantine, movement restrictions, vaccination, and, in some cases, culling of infected animals. Early detection and prompt response are crucial in managing outbreaks and minimizing their impact on agriculture and food supply.
