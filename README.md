# hw4: Implementing KNN to cluster text document

1. Preprocessing and vectorization


To vectorize documents, we used the TF-IDF matrix from hw3. This is an $n x d$ matrix with n documents and d unique words after preprocessing. Each document vector represents a row in   the TF-IDF matrix.



paper: 

Need to write about NCD

Write about 1 + IDF smoothing

Write about how to run it and where to go for this github


Testing testing.... i am different.
